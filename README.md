Weekly exercises and corresponding solutions. Programming language is Python. Attempts have been made to show at least two different solutions for most of the exercises.
I have only included my answers here. Questions can be found athttps://github.com/ktbyers/pynet/tree/master/learning_python. It also contains solutions to those questions from Kirk Byers.
